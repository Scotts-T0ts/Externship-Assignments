Penguin Classification Analysis
Problem Statement:
The Penguin Classification Analysis problem involves predicting the species of a penguin 
based on various physical characteristics. The dataset includes information about the body 
mass, culmen length, culmen depth, flipper length, and sex of different penguin species.
The problem is typically approached as a classification problem, where the target variable is 
the penguin species, and the features are the physical characteristics of the penguins. 
Accurate classification of penguin species can also help researchers understand the effects of 
climate change and other environmental factors on penguin populations. The problem can 
also be useful for conservation efforts, as it can help identify and protect endangered penguin 
species.
Attribute Information:
● Species: penguin species (Chinstrap, Adélie, or Gentoo)
● Island: island name (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe) in Antarctica
● culmen_length_mm: culmen length (mm)
● culmen_depth_mm: culmen depth (mm)
● flipper_length_mm: flipper length (mm)
● body_mass_g: body mass (g)
● Sex: penguin sex
What is culmen?
The upper margin of the beak or bill is referred to as the culmen and the measurement is taken 
using calipers with one jaw at the tip of the upper mandible and the other at base of the skull or the 
first feathers depending on the standard chosen.
